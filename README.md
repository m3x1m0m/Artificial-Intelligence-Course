Repository to work together on the assignments in AI.
## Assignment 1: The Delivery Man Game
A car is supposed to collect parcels and to deliver them as efficient/fast as
possible. The A Star algorithm is leveraged to navigate on a matrix based system
of vertical and horizontal roads with changing traffic conditions. 
## Assignment 2: Where Is Croc?
In a Australian national park there are a bunch of waterholes. In one of these
waterholes there is Croc, a crocodile. Croc has a sensor mounted on his back
wich usually broadcasts besides the location saltinity, phosphate and nitrogen
levels. Unfortunately the sensor is broken and it only measures and transmits
the chemical properties of the waterhole Croc is swimming in i.e. Crocs position
is not known anymore. Croc has to be found. The porbability distribution of
saltinity, phosphate and nitrogen in the different waterholes is know (Gauss).
Also it is known how the waterholes are connected to one another (graph).
Moreover some Swedish backpackers are wandering from waterhole to waterhole. If
backpacker and crocodile coincide it is from this point on known where Croc is
and the backpacker dies. A Hiddem Markov Model is used to solve this problem.
